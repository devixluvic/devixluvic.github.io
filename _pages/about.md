My name is Devon Lutz, and this is the home to all my projects. Vintage computing, programming challenges, and maybe even some progress working on my project car - it all goes here. 

I'm a recent graduate of Simon Fraser University's Software Systems program, a Computing Science field that focuses on applied programming techniques. I often put some of these skills to use in projects listed on this blog, so look out for those!

Currently located in the Vancouver, BC area.
